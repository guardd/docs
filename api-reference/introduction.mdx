## Welcome

The Orcho Risk Generation API provides endpoints for assessing the risk of AI prompts and code changes before execution. Get risk scores from 0-100 with detailed breakdowns across multiple risk factors.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Generate Risk Score" icon="calculator" href="/api-reference/generate-risk">
  Assess risk based on prompt text only
</Card>

<Card title="Risk with Context" icon="code" href="/api-reference/generate-risk-with-context">
  Assess risk with full code context and dependency analysis
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.orcho.ai
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the Authorization header of every request.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.orcho.ai/api/v1/generate-risk' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.orcho.ai/api/v1/generate-risk',
    headers=headers,
    json=request_body
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.orcho.ai/api/v1/generate-risk', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Store it securely in environment variables.
</Warning>

## Risk Assessment Overview

The API evaluates AI tasks across multiple risk dimensions:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Data Sensitivity (Currently Active)">
Analyzes prompts for presence of personally identifiable information (PII), credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data that could pose security risks if exposed.

**Default Weight:** 0.20 (20%)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Input Clarity (Currently Active)">
Evaluates whether the prompt contains all necessary components for successful execution, identifying missing context, unclear instructions, or ambiguous requirements.

**Default Weight:** 0.40 (40%)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Blast Radius (Currently Active)">
Measures the potential impact on your codebase by analyzing dependency graphs to determine how many files and components could be affected by changes. Requires code context.

**Default Weight:** 0.40 (40%)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Context Complexity (Coming Soon)">
Assesses the complexity of the task based on the number of files, dependencies, and interconnections in the provided context.

<Note>This risk factor is planned for future releases.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Legal/IP Risk (Coming Soon)">
Identifies potential legal and intellectual property concerns, including copyright issues, licensing conflicts, and proprietary code considerations.

<Note>This risk factor is planned for future releases.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model Hallucination Rate (Coming Soon)">
Estimates the likelihood of AI model hallucinations based on prompt characteristics, task complexity, and available context.

<Note>This risk factor is planned for future releases.</Note>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Risk Score Interpretation

Risk scores range from **0.0 to 1.0** (decimal values):

| Score Range | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| < 0.2 | Minimal | Safe to proceed automatically |
| 0.2 - 0.39 | Low | Monitor - minimal risk detected |
| 0.4 - 0.59 | Medium | Review recommended - some risk factors detected |
| 0.6 - 0.79 | High | Review required - significant risk factors present |
| ≥ 0.8 | Critical | Block - high risk detected |

<Note>
Scores are returned as decimal values (e.g., 0.65 for high risk), not percentages.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage and system stability. If you exceed rate limits, you'll receive a 429 status code.

<Note>
Contact support@orcho.ai to discuss higher rate limits for enterprise usage.
</Note>

## Health Check

Use the health check endpoint to verify API availability:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.orcho.ai/health
```

```python Python
response = requests.get('https://api.orcho.ai/health')
```
</CodeGroup>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success Response
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T15:30:00Z"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error information:

| Status Code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid input |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| 429 | Rate Limit Exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

<ResponseExample>
```json Error Response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid prompt format",
  "error_code": "HTTP_400",
  "details": {
    "status_code": 400
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>
