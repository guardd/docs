Orcho integrates directly with Jira to automatically assess the risk of every ticket as it's created. Get real-time risk scores and recommendations before work begins, helping teams prioritize security reviews and prevent high-risk implementations.

## Features

## How It Works

When a developer creates a Jira ticket, Orcho automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ticket created">
    Developer creates a new Jira ticket with title and description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orcho analyzes">
    The Orcho app intercepts the creation event and calls the `assess_risk` API with the ticket content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Risk assessment returned">
    Orcho evaluates the ticket for:

    - Data sensitivity
    - Input clarity
    - Potential blast radius
    - Security concerns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Risk displayed">
    Risk score and level are added as custom fields on the ticket:

    - **Risk Score:** 0.72
    - **Risk Level:** HIGH
    - **Recommendations:** Review required before implementation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Team notified">
    For high-risk tickets (≥ 0.6), stakeholders are automatically notified
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Risk Assessment Fields

Orcho adds the following custom fields to your Jira tickets:

<ParamField path="Orcho Risk Score" type="number">
  Overall risk score from 0.0 (minimal risk) to 1.0 (critical risk)

  Example: `0.72`
</ParamField>

  Risk level category: minimal, low, medium, high, or critical

  Example: `HIGH`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Orcho Risk Factors" type="object">
  Breakdown of individual risk factor scores

  Example:

  ```
  Data Sensitivity: 0.85
  Input Clarity: 0.62
  Blast Radius: N/A (no context)
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Orcho Recommendations" type="array">
  Actionable recommendations for mitigating risk

  Example:

  - Add WHERE clause to limit scope

## Example Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Ticket

<ResponseExample>

```

```

</ResponseExample>

## Workflow Automation

### Automatic Approvals

Configure Jira workflows to require approvals based on risk:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High Risk (≥ 0.6)">
    **Require approval from:**

    - Security team lead
    - Engineering manager
    - Product owner

    **Workflow:**

    1. Ticket created → Risk assessed
    2. If risk ≥ 0.6 → Status changes to "Security Review"
    3. Security team notified automatically
    4. Requires approval before moving to "In Progress"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Critical Risk (≥ 0.8)">
    **Require approval from:**

    - CISO or Security Director
    - CTO or VP Engineering
    - Legal (for data deletion/modification)

    **Workflow:**

    1. Ticket created → Risk assessed
    2. If risk ≥ 0.8 → Status changes to "Blocked - Critical Risk"
    3. Executive team notified via Slack/email
    4. Requires written justification and multiple approvals
    5. Must be reviewed in security committee meeting
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Low Risk (< 0.4)">
    **Auto-approve:**

    - No additional approval needed
    - Standard development workflow
    - Automatically moves to "Ready for Development"

    **Workflow:**

    1. Ticket created → Risk assessed
    2. If risk \< 0.4 → Status changes to "Ready for Development"
    3. Team can begin work immediately
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Options

### Risk Thresholds

```jql
"Orcho Risk Level" = "HIGH" OR "Orcho Risk Level" = "CRITICAL"
```

### Find Tickets Needing Review

```jql
"Orcho Risk Score" >= 0.6 AND status = "Security Review"
```

### Find Safe-to-Implement Tickets

```jql
"Orcho Risk Level" IN ("MINIMAL", "LOW") AND status = "Ready for Development"
```

### Find Tickets by Risk Factor

```jql
"Orcho Risk Factors" ~ "Data Sensitivity: 0.9*"
```

### Risk Distribution Dashboard

Create a dashboard showing:

- Total tickets by risk level (pie chart)

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with monitoring mode">
    Enable for 1-2 projects initially to tune thresholds before org-wide rollout
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train your team">
    Educate developers on:

    - How risk assessment works
    - What different risk levels mean
    - How to write safer ticket descriptions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review blocked tickets">
    Hold weekly reviews of blocked tickets to:

    - Understand common high-risk patterns
    - Adjust thresholds if needed
    - Improve ticket writing practices
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate with existing workflows">
    Don't create parallel workflows - integrate risk assessment into existing approval processes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and iterate">
    Track metrics:

    - False positive rate (safe tickets marked high-risk)
    - False negative rate (risky tickets marked low-risk)
    - Time spent in security review
    - Developer feedback
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### Custom Risk Weights

Adjust risk factor weights based on your organization's priorities:

```json
{
  "data_sensitivity": 0.40,
  "input_clarity": 0.30,
  "blast_radius": 0.20,
  "legal_ip_risk": 0.10
}
```

Configure in: Settings → Apps → Orcho Configuration → Risk Weights

### Jira Automation Rules

Create automation rules triggered by risk assessment:

**Example: Auto-assign high-risk tickets**

```
Trigger: Issue Created
Condition: Orcho Risk Level = "HIGH" OR "CRITICAL"
Action: Assign to Security Team
```

**Example: Add label for tracking**

```
Trigger: Issue Created
Condition: Orcho Risk Score >= 0.6
Action: Add label "security-review-required"
```

**Example: Update priority**

```
Trigger: Issue Created  
Condition: Orcho Risk Level = "CRITICAL"
Action: Set Priority = Highest
```
